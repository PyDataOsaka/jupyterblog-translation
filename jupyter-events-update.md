# Jupyter Events Update

New Role: Jupyter Community Events Manager

Hello Jupyter Community!
My name is Gayle Ollington, and I am the new Jupyter Community Events Manager.
I am thrilled to be joining this community and would like to briefly introduce my new role at NumFOCUS.

I have worked in the event industry for 16+ years, and have managed a wide variety of events ranging from small meetings and concerts to industry trade shows and press launches.
Big or small, an event is an opportunity to tell a story through a shared experience.
I am passionate about bringing people together in organic and meaningful ways.
I believe great things come out of collaborative culture.
Something that the open-source community has in abundance.

My role was created by the strategic vision of the Community Building Committee (CBC) and is made possible by generous funding from Bloomberg and Amazon Web Services.
The committee is led by Ana Ruvalcaba, Sylvain Corlay, and Jason Grout.
As I mentioned above, my role is formally a part of the NumFOCUS family for which Project Jupyter is a Sponsored Project.

I look forward to seeing where this new chapter of my career will take me as I grow and develop in this role.
During these next few months, I will be working closely with the CBC and the Jupyter community to focus on the next JupyterCon as well as Jupyter Community Workshops.

I have worked in a variety of industries and have found that the best way to know what a community wants is to simply ask.
Here is a poll to give me a better idea of what you would like to see in upcoming events, including JupyterCon.
Please share your thoughts on the poll no later than Fri, May 6th.
Thank you in advance for the valuable input.

Stay tuned for more details on the next JupyterCon as well as other community events.
My focus will be on facilitating creating and supporting events that will enable this community to continue to work together and learn from one another.
