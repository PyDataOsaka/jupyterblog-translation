# Jupyter コミュニティのワークショップ: 提案募集

<!-- ## Call for Proposals for July 2022 — April 2023 -->
## 2022年7月から2023年4月までの提案募集

<!-- We are pleased to announce that the next call for proposals for Jupyter Community Workshops is [now open](https://forms.gle/1FsSTKaQDNJSSBDG8)! -->
Jupyter コミュニティのワークショップの次の提案募集が[始まった](https://forms.gle/1FsSTKaQDNJSSBDG8)ことをお知らせします！

<!-- The majority of Jupyter’s work is accomplished through online collaboration;
yet, over the years, we found value in focused in-person workshops.
In-person events are particularly useful for tackling challenging development and design projects, growing the community of contributors, and for strengthening collaborations. -->
Jupyter の作業の大部分は、オンラインのコラボレーションを通じて行われます。
それでも、何年にもわたって、人が集まる対面のワークショップに価値を見出してきました。
対面式のイベントは、チャレンジングな開発や設計プロジェクトに取り組み、貢献者のコミュニティを成長させ、コラボレーションを強化するのに特に役立ちます。

Jupyter Community Workshops is a series of community-organized events to enable such gatherings.
See examples of recent workshops [here](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshops-a7f1dca1735e),
and stay tuned for updates on the current round of workshops.

We are grateful for the initial and continuing financial support by Bloomberg and Amazon Web Services that makes our workshops possible.
If your organization would like to support this program, please contact [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).

**The fourth call for proposals for Jupyter Community Workshops is open through S̶u̶n̶d̶a̶y̶,̶ ̶M̶a̶y̶ ̶2̶2̶,̶ ̶2̶0̶2̶2̶ Monday, June 6, 2022.**

Jupyter Community Workshops bring together small groups of Jupyter community members and core contributors for high-impact strategic work and community engagement on focused topics.
Events funded in this round would occur no later than April 30, 2023.

These workshops are expected to involve up to two dozen participants over the course of two to four days, in an in-person or virtual format.
Depending on the format of the event, proposals may include a Jupyter-funded budget for direct expenses of up to $20,000 to reimburse in-person events or up to $5,000 for virtual events.
Direct expenses include, for example, travel expenses, speaker promotional items, video conferencing platform, accommodation, meals and event space.
(Please note this is not a grant with overhead or indirect costs.)
It is our intent the workshops will include both participants who are core Jupyter contributors and stakeholders, contributors, and potential contributors within the larger Jupyter ecosystem.
Participants should be at least 18 years old (i.e., not minors).
While not the primary focus of the workshops, it would be highly beneficial to couple the workshop with broader community outreach events, such as sprints, talks, or tutorials at local meetings or conferences.
For examples of recent workshops, see some [proposals funded in a recent round](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshops-a7f1dca1735e).

### Proposal Process Highlights:

1. Submit initial proposal using this form by S̶u̶n̶d̶a̶y̶,̶ ̶M̶a̶y̶ ̶2̶2̶,̶ ̶2̶0̶2̶2̶ Monday, June 6, 2022 (Anywhere on Earth).
2. Initial Jupyter Community Building Committee (CBC) review (up to a week). Proposal goes to CBC for initial review and feedback. Proposal is either approved or declined.
3. Budget and Logistics Development (up to four weeks). Jupyter Community Events Manager will support workshop organizers, who will develop a venue/date proposal, detailed budget, event plan, and proposed list of participants.
4. Final CBC review (up to a week). Proposal presented for final approval to CBC, including final budget, event details, and an estimate of the potential impact of the event. Assuming the budget included in the initial proposal is fully developed and no major changes are proposed, this period may be waived.

The proposal process for these workshops is managed by the Jupyter Community Building Committee, NumFOCUS and the Jupyter Community Events Manager, Gayle Ollington (gayle@numfocus.org). Applications can be completed using the online form and are due by Sunday, May 22, 2022 (Anywhere on Earth). Events should be hosted no later than April 30, 2023.
